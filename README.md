# Cloud Computing Mini-Project


Mini Project on REST services. The following functionalities are performed 

  - Spotify API is considered to process various requests and OAuth2.0 authentication is used to obtain the access_token of the user
  - The data obtained from spotify is displayed in a neatly formatted HTML webpage 
  - The Spotify API requests are served over HTTPS
  - Data is downloaded from Spotify API in json format and converted to csv format and the converted data is copied to cassandra database
  - GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests are processed on the data stored in cassandra
  - Docker image is built for the above mentioned services
  - Kubertnetes is used for load-balancing.

### SPOTIFY API

  - GET the details of user's currently_playing track
  - GET the cover_image of user specified playlist
  - GET the recommendation of genres for the user
  - POST- Create playlist for the user
  - POST- Add tracks to the user's specified playlist
  - PUT- Save a particular album
  - DELETE - Unfollow an artist
 **Note: Every requests has a scope which the user must give permission to.

### Processing requests for Spotify API 
  - Using https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference-beta/ get the access_token for the above mentioned requests where you need to choose the scope required and get the access_token. The user(ie. in this case I am the user) will be redirected to a webpage where she needs to grant permission.
  - programs/app.py contains all the above mentioned requests.
  - Once, the request is processed succesfully, you will be redirected to a webpage.
  - GET requests leads to HTML webpages -- programs/templates/.. contains the HTML files.
  - PUT, POST and DELETE requests are processed via GET requests explicitly and they show a success message.
  - app.run(host='0.0.0.0', ssl_context='adhoc') is used to run the Flask where 'adhoc' certificates are used run the app over HTTPS.


  Once you login into amazon EC2 t2.medium instance
  ```sh
  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install python3-pip
  $ pip3 install Flask
  $ pip3 install requests
  $ pip3 install pyopenssl
  $ cd coursework
  $ cd programs
  $ python3 app.py
  ```
 
 
  Go to https://ec2-54-172-5-180.compute-1.amazonaws.com/{..} to observe the outputs of the created app. Below are the urls of requests served.
 - currently_playing - To get the details of the currently_playing track
 ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caraevangeline/coursework/master/images/Fig1.jpg)
 - cover_image/<play_id> - To get the cover image of the play_id
 ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caraevangeline/coursework/master/images/Fig2.png)
 - recommendations - To the genre recommendations for the user
 ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caraevangeline/coursework/master/images/Fig3.jpg)
 - create_playlist/<user_id> - Create a playlist for the user (user_id)
 ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caraevangeline/coursework/master/images/Fig4.png)
![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caraevangeline/coursework/master/images/Fig13.jpg)
 - add_tracks/<playlist_id> - Add tracks to playlist_id
 -![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caraevangeline/coursework/master/images/Fig5.png)
![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caraevangeline/coursework/master/images/Fig14.jpg)
 - save_album/<album_id> - Save album with id = album_id to the user's account
 ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caraevangeline/coursework/master/images/Fig6.png)
![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caraevangeline/coursework/master/images/Fig15.jpg)
 - unfollow_artist/<artist_id> - Unfollow the artist with id = artist_id

### Create database for cassandra
 
- programs/database.py contains the code to retrieve the songs, realease_date and spotify uri of 4 albums [sums upto 195 rows of record with 4 columns] and the file is saved in spotify.csv
```sh
$ cd programs
$ python3 database.py
```
### Store data to Cassandra
- Pull the latest version of cassandra image into docker
- Create a workspace
- Create the table and copy the database obtained from previous step.
```sh
$ sudo apt install docker.io
$ sudo docker pull cassandra:latest
$ sudo docker run --name coursework -p 9042:9042 -d cassandra:latest
$ sudo docker cp spotify.csv coursework:/home/spotify.csv
$ sudo docker exec -it coursework cqlsh
cqlsh>CREATE KEYSPACE spotify WITH REPLICATION = {'class' : 'SimpleStrategy',       .....'replication_factor' : 1};
cqlsh>CREATE TABLE spotify.statistics (artist text,song text PRIMARY KEY, 
 .....date text,uri text);
cqlsh>COPY spotify.statistics(artist,song,date,uri)
 .....FROM '/home/spotify.csv'
 .....WITH DELIMITER=',' AND HEADER=FALSE;
 cqlsh>exit
```
commands.txt contains the required commands and queries .

### Process requests for Cassandra
- GET requests to get the album to which a particular song belongs to.
- POST to insert a row with given attributes
- PUT to update artist name for a particular song
- DELETE to delete a record from the database

programs/cw1.py contains the combined code to process both cassandra database requests and Spotify API requests.
  ```sh
 $ sudo docker inspect coursework
  ```
  Use the above command to look for the ip-address and make the corresponding changes in cw1.py in line 4
   ```sh
   $ sudo docker build . --tag=cassandrarest:v1
   $ sudo docker run -p 80:80 cassandrarest:v1
   ```
  The above commands are to build an image and to run the requests desired. 
  - To see the GET request open https://ec2-54-172-5-180.compute-1.amazonaws.com/spotify_display/<song_name>
![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caraevangeline/coursework/master/images/Fig8.png) 
  - To process POST, type the below command in another terminal
  ```sh
   $ curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"song":"Ha_cara1","artist":"cara","date":"10-10-2020","uri":"spotify:album:cara"}' http://ec2-54-172-5-180.compute-1.amazonaws.com/spotify_create
   ```
   ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caraevangeline/coursework/master/images/Fig9.jpg)
  - To process PUT, give the below command from another terminal
   ```sh
   $ curl -X "PUT" http://ec2-54-172-5-180.compute-1.amazonaws.com/spotify_update/Ha_cara
   ```
   ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caraevangeline/coursework/master/images/Fig11.jpg)
   - For DELETE,
   ```sh
   $ curl -X "DELETE" http://ec2-54-172-5-180.compute-1.amazonaws.com/spotify_delete/Ha_cara
   ```

 ### Kubertnetes for load balancing


> Containers are a good way to bundle and run your applications. In a production environment, you need to manage the containers that run the applications and ensure that there is no downtime. For example, if a container goes down, another container needs to start. Wouldn’t it be easier if this behavior was handled by a system?
That’s how Kubernetes comes to the rescue! Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently. It takes care of scaling and failover for your application, provides deployment patterns, and more. For example, Kubernetes can easily manage a canary deployment for your system.

Below commands are to install microk8s to run kubernetes and to check status
```sh
$ sudo snap install microk8s --classic
$ sudo microk8s.status
$ sudo microk8s.kubectl get nodes
$ sudo snap alias microk8s.kubectl kubectl
$ sudo kubectl get nodes
$ sudo snap list
```
To create deployment.apps, pods and to do scaling and to expose app to external ip below are the commands 
```sh
$ sudo kubectl create deployment coursework --image=cassandrarest:v1
$ sudo kubectl run coursework --image=cassandrarest:v1 --port=80
$ sudo kubectl scale deployment coursework --replicas=3
$ sudo kubectl expose deployment coursework --type=LoadBalancer --name=coursework --port=80
$ sudo kubectl patch service coursework -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer", "externalIPs":["54.172.5.180"]}}'
```
![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caraevangeline/coursework/master/images/Fig12.png)

To view or delete Deployment
```sh
$ sudo kubectl get all
$ sudo kubectl delete deployment.apps/coursework
$ sudo kubectl delete pod/coursework
$ sudo kubectl delete service/coursework
```
